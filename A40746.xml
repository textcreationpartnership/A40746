            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOU have already heard the good Tidings of that eminent Victory obtained by His Majeſties Forces againſt the Rebels; and this comes onely to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, in ſome particulars of that glorious Action, the ſucceſs where of, hath cauſed a new face of things, diſperfing all thoſe black Clouds that ſeemed to threaten this poor Kingdom, which now appears in a poſture of Joy and Triumph; and we do not doubt but in very few days we ſhall be reſtored to an intire Tranquility, for the Body of the Nation was not at all Tainted or Infected with the Rebellious poiſon, but upon all occaſions are ready to expreſs their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, whereof they have in this juncture given ſignal inſtances, by their ready and chearful coming out to ſerve His Majeſty,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105394:2"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->
and the general abhorrence they every where expreſs againſt theſe inſolent Rebels, their Principles and Practices, and all that abet or comply with them.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe vile wretches, no fewer than 1200 were this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon brought in Priſoners hither, and for the preſent are kept in the <hi>Gray-friars Church-yard,</hi> under a very ſtrong Guard. And we have a certain Account, that there were killed of their Party at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> and about <hi>Hamilton-Park,</hi> 800 and upwards, beſides the great numbers that have been ſlain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>Our gallant General, his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Buchlugh</hi> and <hi>Monmouth,</hi> gave freſh proofs of his Conduct and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in this Affair, and we know not which we ought firſt to admire, his indefatigable Prudence in giving the neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or, his Courage and Bravery in charging the thickeſt of the Rebels, without the leaſt apprehenſion of danger. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his great Example, the whole Nobility and Gentry behaved themſelves with a ſingular Gallantry; nor were any of our Troops wanting in their duty, or that deſerved not a particular recommendation; eſpecially Captain <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claver-houſe,</hi> who with his own hands took the two Standards before-mentioned, his Troop remembring the ſlaughter the Rebels made amongſt them, on the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> reſolved now to have full ſatisfaction, and therefore utterly refuſed either to give or take Quarter. Likewiſe ſome <hi>High-landers</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Earl of <hi>Murry,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> charged the Rebels Left-wing with ſuch fury, that the ſlain were left on the place as it were in heaps.</p>
                  <p>The Rebels had 4 pieces of Cannon, one of which they threw into the River of <hi>Clyd,</hi> the other 3 were taken. And that you may judg of the temper of the Men, and what Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties they would have exerciſed, had they been Maſters of the Field. I muſt not forget to inform you, that there were likewiſe taken two pair of Gallows, which they carried along with them; One was like our ordinary Tools of that kinde, and this was for the poorer ſort. But the other, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105394:2"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->
for the Gentry, was of a mode wholly new, and ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly contrived, that I know not well how to deſcribe it; 'Tis one ſtreight piece of Wood with a Screw, having 12 or 15 branches which ſcrewed up to the top, where there was a croſs piece of wood full of long Iron Spikes, on which the Heads of Perſons of Quality were to be fixt; and each of the aforeſaid Branches had an Iron Hook at the end, to hang people on. Thus the inſolent and cruel Rebels had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, like proud <hi>Haman,</hi> their Gallows for the Kings good Subjects; but like him too, are themſelves like to ſuffer on them, as they well deſerve for their Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Juſt now News is brought, that Capt. <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claver-houſe</hi> having purſued a Party of the Rebels Horſe as far as <hi>Air,</hi> did there ſo warmely Engage them, that moſt of them are Killed or taken Priſoners; amongſt which laſt, 'tis ſaid, is <hi>Welſh,</hi> that notorious Preaching Trumpet of Sedition.</p>
                  <p>There have been ſince Sunday killed in ſeveral places above 400, and divers of the Kings Forces are ſtill abroad in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in purſuit of them, and hourly pick up ſome of them; but the General with the Groſs of the Army, is at preſent at <hi>Ruglen,</hi> and intend for <hi>Glaſcow</hi> to morrow.</p>
                  <p>The Privy-Councel have ordered diligent ſearch to be made amongſt the Priſoners and the ſlain, for the Murtherers of his Grace the late Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> and that if any of them be found amongſt the Dead, their Bodies to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up in Chains; if amongſt the Priſoners, that they ſhall more ſtrictly be ſecured in order to their Tryal.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Priſoners ſeem to be very ſenſible of their Wickedneſs in joyning in this horrid Rebellion, and do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that their Miniſters drew them into the fame, by bold and ſeditious Sermons, perverting and abuſing Scripture, ſcandalizing and miſ-repreſenting the Government and chief Magiſtrates; and withal to encourage them, had given them great aſſurances of large Supplies and Aſſiſtance both of Men and Money from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
